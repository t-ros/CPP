 ## Overview
 This program **reads numerical data** from a text file (num_file.txt), displays the values rounded to three decimal places, and counts the total number of numbers. It then **stores** these values in a vector and **writes them to a binary file** (num_file.bin).
 â€¢ The ".bin" will have 80 bytes assuming each double weights 8 bytes.
